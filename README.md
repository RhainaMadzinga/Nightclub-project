# Nightclub Management System

Overview

This small, independent project is designed to manage a nightclub's occupancy levels. The system is intended for a company that operates nightclubs and needs to track the number of clubbers present at any given time to ensure compliance with fire safety regulations. The system allows for recording the details of individual nightclubs, including their names, maximum capacities, and current occupancy levels, and provides functionality to manage clubbers entering and exiting while enforcing capacity limits.

Features

- Independent Nightclub Management: Each class instance represents a single nightclub with its name, capacity, and current occupancy level.
- Occupancy Control: Allows adjusting the occupancy as clubbers arrive and leave.
- Capacity Enforcement: Ensures that occupancy never exceeds the nightclubâ€™s capacity.
Simple Integration: This project is designed to be standalone but can easily be integrated into larger management systems if needed.
